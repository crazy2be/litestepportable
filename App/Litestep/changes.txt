-- CHANGES SINCE 0.24.7 --------------------------------------------------------

 - New combined evaluation parser for If/ElseIf and inline $a+b$ expressions.
   Supports string comparisons and built-in functions among other improvements.

 - Added checks for recursively defined variables to VarExpansionEx.

 - Fixed threading/reentrant crash in MessageManager.

 - Updates for Notification Icon Handler (systray service).
   * Fixed non persistent data from always being retained.
   * Fixed always sending NID data as new/updated when it wasn't.
     (Fixes bogus info/balloon tips on recycle)
   * Fixed possible internal data corruption by rouge systray modules.
   * Fixed "dead icons" from being sent to systray modules on recycle.
   * Added basic "shared icon" tracking.

 - Removed !gather bang command proxy for VWM modules (all current VWM modules
   now implement that function internally).

 - Fixed ParseCmdLine's szRcPath creation from inserting an extra backslash.

 - Much improved initialization/recycle of LSAPI internals.

 - Added support for "AppBars". Appbars are windows that dock to the side of
   the screen, some of which "autohide".  Typical uses are Media Player's
   navigation bars, or Instant Messenger's contact list window.  Appbars may
   also cause the work area to be changed.

 - Changed bang !alert messagebox caption to "!Alert Litestep" to make apparent
   what generated the messagebox.

 - Fixed error handling when encountering invalid If/ElseIf syntax.

 - Now checks for ElseIf following Else directive and skips conditional block
   if this invalid structure occurs.

 - Improved debug TRACE message output during step.rc parsing for debug builds.

 - Default all platform variables (eg. "WinNT") to "false" prior to setting
   conditional to "true".

 - Added Win2003 platform variable.

 - Fixed semicolon following ELSE or ENDIF statement from breaking parser.

 - Command line !bang handler now allows running LS instance to set foreground
   window.

 - Fixed possible lockup condition on startup/recycle if there existed a non
   responsive application on the desktop.

 - Fixed !about bang command from launching concurrent AboutBox instances.

 - Fixed LS logo not showing in about box. Moved logo to the left.

 - The compile date is now fetched from PE header.

 - $CompileDate$ now has the full "Compiled on" string as shown in the !about
   box.

 - Now using DeferWindowPos in Show/Hide/ToggleModules bang commands.  This
   allows for "apparent" instant showing/hiding of all module windows.

 - Improvements to LSAutoHideModules.

 - Added a more specific error message when failing to load a module because of
   unresolved dependencies.

 - Targeting libpng 1.2.29 and zlib 1.2.3.

 - Many other incremental fixes and code cleanup changes... Thanks for reading.
